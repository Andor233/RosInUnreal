# RosUnreal

Run native ros under unreal.

Tested in Linux with unreal 4.26 without change any engine code.

I used to try build ros as a static or shared libary, but failed, so I just put ros into unreal.

Delete ros console and something else, only remain core function.

TODO:
- Compatible with windows(I have a windows version but it needs to change engine code)
- Use unreal log instead of ros log
